Welcome, please have a look around.
Kind of everything you will find is connected with the Arctic.
This has a simple reason: my work is my passion. 

I am very grateful that I had the chance to visit the Arctic twice already.
During my master studies I lived for half a year in Longyearbyen, Svalbard.
I studied Arctic Geophysics and discovered the beauty of the Arctic.
Snow and ice always fascinated me... but after my first days up in the North, I was totally in love.
Therefore, the decision was easy - I focus in Arctic science and deal everyday with important and interesting aspects of our Earth's climate.

My current project allowed me to have the biggest adventure of my early career.
I was part of the last leg of the MOSAiC expedition (www.mosaic-expedition.org).
The personal and professional experiences and learnings were amazing.
Therefore, I decided to share this with others via social media, education or other media (see Outreach).
My goal is to reach people, explain how the Arctic works and encourage them to have a closer look.
The current changes in our climate are strongest in the Arctic and are strong communicator in itself because the beauty starts slowly to disapear.

Would you like to know more, do you have any questions or would like to have a chat about the Arctic? Please contact me via Twitter or Email.
